    <h1>My favorite City</h1>
    <P>My favorite city is Accra, Ghana. It is well known for being one of the most peaceful and
        well-preserved cities in Africa and the world. Accra is the capital and largest city of
        Ghana, located on the southern coast along the Gulf of Guinea, which is part of the Atlantic
        Ocean.
        In common usage, the name “Accra” often refers to the territory of the Accra Metropolitan
        District as it existed before 2008, when it covered an area of 199.4 km² (77.0 sq mi).
        Accra, as a city, and Ghana as a country are beautiful places that many people would love to
        live in
        because
        of the loving and friendly way the citizens relate to and care for one another.
        .</P>
