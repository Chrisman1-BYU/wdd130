           Black Star Square, also known as Independence Square, is a public square in Accra, Ghana. It is bordered by the Accra Sports Stadium and the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park. The site often hosts annual Independence Day celebrations and other national events, including civic and military parades. It was completed in 1961 in preparation for the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ghana.
