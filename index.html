        <p>Hello! My name is Chrisman Asamoah and I am from Accra, Ghana. I enjoy reading and
            playing soccer. As a BYU-Pathway student, I am currently studying Software Development
            and I am excited to learn more about software development and research work. I look
            forward to creating my own websites and seeing what the future holds for me.</p>
